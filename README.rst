Hmsc-HPC
========

This repository contains the TensorFlow implementation of Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC), serving as an extension to the existing R package, Hmsc-R. It provides a flexible framework for Joint Species Distribution Modelling (JSDM), enabling robust analysis and modeling of species communities.

The Hmsc-HPC paper is published in `PLOS Computational Biology <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011914>`_
