Hmsc-HPC
========

This repository contains the TensorFlow implementation of Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC), serving as an extension to the existing R package, Hmsc-R. It provides a flexible framework for Joint Species Distribution Modelling (JSDM), enabling robust analysis and modeling of species communities.
